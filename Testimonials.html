				<blockquote>“I realized the street life that I was living was not good for me or my children. I was tired of living that life.” -Jordan Price
				</blockquote>
				<p>	Jordan voluntarily enrolled in the Father to Father program in November of 2005.  At the time of his enrollment he was actively using drugs and alcohol. Although he came from a sound family background, he succumbed to the temptations of the streets and pursued a life of easy money and quick highs.
					Jordan has a GED and is the father of five children by four different women. He does not work because of a physical disability. He came to the program simply to ask for help.  He said  “I realized the street life that I was living was not good for me or my children. I was tired of living that life.”</p>

				<blockquote>“Now my focus is on being a better man, a better father and a better Christian.”</blockquote>

				<p>Jordan became actively involved in his church and the Father to Father program. The only time he missed a meeting was to attend a church function. He freely admits that he lived a life of drugs and alcohol but with the help of the Father to Father Project, Inc. and his decision to give his life to Jesus Christ, he has conquered all of those addictions and now my focus is on being a better man, a better father and a better Christian.”</p>
				<p>When Jordan enrolled in the program, he scored 19 on the Barksdale Self-esteem Scale.  A score of 50 or less indicates a “crippling lack of self-esteem." Prior to graduation from the program, Jordan took the Barksdale Self-esteem Test again and his score was 88.</p>
				<p>Tavis truly is a changed man. He gives the credit to his relationship with Christ and feels that God definitely touched him through the Father to Father Project. </p>
